# Indian Gut Microbiome Project

In this project, we are going to explore the differences in the gut microbiomes of Indian populations living in India and Canada, compared to European controls. 

## Introduction 
The purpose of this study was to investigate the impact of immigration to Canada on the gut microbiome of Indians. Stool samples were collected from the following cohorts:
1. Indians living in India **(Indians)**
2. Indian migrants to Canada **(Indo-Immigr)**
3. Indians born in Canada **(Indo-Can)**
4. Euro-Canadians **(Euro-Can)**
5. Euro-Immigrants **(Euro-Immigr)**
Both 16S and shotgun sequencing were done on all samples to compare bacterial compositions and the functional potential of their microbiomes. Dietary data and demographic data was also collected and analyzed in Prism (analysis not shown here).
